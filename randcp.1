.SH NAME
randcp \- Copy files randomly, optionally matching a pattern

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B randcp
[\fIOPTION\fR...] \fISOURCE DEST\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy files randomly from SOURCE to DEST. The following options control the
behaviour of the program. The program copies files recursively, without
maintaining the folder structure itself. This behaviour is intended since this
program was written to copy music files randomly without hierachy.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-insensitive\fR
Case insensitive match
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-limit\fR=\fILIMIT\fR
Limit number of copied files. The default is one file.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pattern\fR=\fIPATTERN\fR
Copy files matching PATTERN. By defaut the pattern is based on the POSIX.2 regular
expressions which programs like grep use.
.TP
\-?, \fB\-\-help\fR
Give this help list
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Give a short usage message
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.

.SH NOTES
randcp builds a tree representation of the SRC directory internally to enable
randomizing the results. So if the depth of the SRC directory is high, then
randcp will take a noticeable amount of time in the beginning before the copying
starts, which is indicated from the 'N% copied' output.
