noncoreutils
============

A list of utils that is useful in someway but not as imporant as the tools in
the coreutils. First such tool is the randcp. This copies files randomly. I use
this to copy music files randomly to memory sticks to listen to at work or while
driving. Hoping to get the need and write more tools in the future.
